[CAUTION]: No matter the patching method you choose to use it's important
that you replace the original with our own altered 000f4e00.code plugin file
so that all the files of the translation will work properly!

While a big portion of the scripts have been proofread, not all scripts have
yet been checked and verified so there may be some common mistakes/issues/misplacements.
