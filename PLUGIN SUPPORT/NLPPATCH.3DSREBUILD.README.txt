You need a cart, digital,'.3ds' or '.cia' file of the game.

First dump the game(follow this step if you want to dump your own game files,
Otherwise skip this step and use the files provided with the 'Gamefilepack' and 'exefs_exheader'):

Download the 3dsbuilder tool:

Https://github.Com/sciresm/3ds-builder/releases

If you didn't dump the game download the '[NLP+].Gamefilepack.7z'(1.42gb):

If you didn't dump the game download '[NLP+].exefs_exheader':
Https://mega.Nz/#!G5rycyzz!C-42geozv1ih0nny6gkynailfgcdqp7-8le1jatvfdw

Replace the original with the [NLPPATCH] files in 'romfs' folders.

Visit this thread and follow the 'rebuilding for cfw / flashcards​' instructions:
Https://gbatemp.Net/threads/tutorial-how-to-decrypt-extract-rebuild-3ds-roms.383055/

Use the 'decryptedexefs.Bin' and 'decryptedexheader.Bin' files when they are requested.

Remember to tick 'use pre-build exefs' when adding the exefs.

Don't forget to add the '.3ds' extention when you name the file.

You'll now have a playable '.3ds' file that you can run with flashcards.

Turn this '.3ds' in '.cia' for cfw:

For the resulting file to run (with Citra, etc) you first need to also decrypt the file with 'decrypt9':
