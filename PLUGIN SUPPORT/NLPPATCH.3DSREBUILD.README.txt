You need a cart, digital, a decrypted '.3DS' or a decrypted '.CIA' file of the game.
(follow this step if you want to dump your own game files,
otherwise skip this step and use the files provided with the 'Gamefilepack' and 'exefs_exheader')

to dump a cart use 'Uncart' which is lossless and more reliable ('Braindump' is lossy and  might cause problems):

If you can't find a 'decypted' version of '.3DS' / '.CIA' first "decrypt(deep)" the file using 'Decrypt9':

If you didn't dump the game download the '[NLP+].Gamefilepack.zip'(1.48GB):

If you didn't dump the game download '[NLP+].exefs_exheader':

How to inject [NLPPATCH] files in 'ExtractedRomFS':
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To extract and rebuild a '.3DS' file visit here:
Https://gbatemp.Net/threads/tutorial-how-to-decrypt-extract-rebuild-3ds-roms.383055/

To extract and rebuild a '.CIA' file visit here:
https://gbatemp.net/threads/tutorial-how-to-decrypt-extract-and-rebuild-a-cia.388677/

if you Want to rebuild the '[NLP+].Gamefilepack.zip' files skip the 'extract' step.

After extracting replace the original with the [NLPPATCH] files in 'ExtractedRomFS' folders.

Visit either of these threads and follow the 'rebuilding for cfw / flashcards​' instructions:
Https://gbatemp.Net/threads/tutorial-how-to-decrypt-extract-rebuild-3ds-roms.383055/
https://gbatemp.net/threads/tutorial-how-to-decrypt-extract-and-rebuild-a-cia.388677/

Load the 3DSBuilder tool:
Https://gbatemp.Net/threads/release-3ds-builder.388858/
Https://github.Com/sciresm/3ds-builder/releases

Use the 'decryptedexefs.Bin' and 'decryptedexheader.Bin' files when they are requested.

Remember to tick 'use pre-build exefs' when adding the exefs.

Don't forget to add the '.3DS' extention when you name the file.

You'll now have a playable '.3DS' file that you can run with flashcards.

Turn this '.3DS' in '.CIA' for cfw:
Https://gbatemp.Net/threads/release-3ds-simple-cia-converter.384559/
(Based on the method you used you might need the xorpads for this action.)

For the resulting file to run (with Citra, etc) you need to also "decrypt(deep)" the resulting file with 'Decrypt9':
