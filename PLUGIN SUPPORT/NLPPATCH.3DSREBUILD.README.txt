First dump the game(follow this step if you want to dump your own game files,
otherwise skip this step and use the files provided with the 'Gamefilepack' and 'exefs_exheader'):

Download the 3DSBuilder tool:

Https://github.Com/sciresm/3ds-builder/releases

If you didn't dump the game download the '[NLP+].Gamefilepack.7z'(1.42gb):
https://mega.nz/#!10Zl2KrA!lHggr9WaDWPg3AAWsgeT3XoZsgOuWZDOMicpMMj_M3Y

If you didn't dump the game download '[NLP+].exefs_exheader':
https://mega.nz/#!g5RyCYZZ!c-42GEoZv1iH0NnY6gKyNAIlFgcDQP7-8LE1JAtvFDw

Replace the original with the [NLPPATCH] files in 'romfs' folders.

Visit this thread and follow the 'rebuilding for cfw / flashcards​' instructions:
Https://gbatemp.Net/threads/tutorial-how-to-decrypt-extract-rebuild-3ds-roms.383055/

Use the 'decryptedexefs.Bin' and 'decryptedexheader.Bin' files when they are requested.

Remember to tick 'use pre-build exefs' when adding the exefs.

Don't forget to add the '.3DS' extention when you name the file.

You'll now have a playable '.3DS' file that you can run with flashcards.

Turn this '.3DS' in '.CIA' for cfw:

For the resulting file to run (with Citra, etc) you first need to also decrypt the file with 'Decrypt9':
